# Houses of Westeros

When you play the Game of Rails, you win or you die.

You'll be making a Ruby on Rails app connecting Game of Thrones characters to their respective houses. Implement full CRUD functionality on the models.

We will start off with two models: `Houses` and `Characters`.

## Models + Migrations

- Create ERD for Houses and Characters
- Create models and migrations for Houses and Characters
- Create seed data for Houses and Characters

## Views + Controllers

- Add views and controllers.

## Helpers

- Use links, forms, etc. to helpers.

## User Notifications

- Implement validations, error-handling and flash.


## Bonus

- Implement nested routes
- Add a third model for quotes associated with a character.
- Try out many-to-many relationships with tags to label characters. A character can have many tags and a tag can be associated with many characters. One way to tag characters can be based on personality traits.
